In this project you will design and implement a web application that communicates with PocketBase, a configurable back-end application that provides authentication and data storage. Introducing a back end and accessing its functionality from JavaScript will allow you to implement features that were not possible with client-side JavaScript in Project 3 or with Remake in Project 2.

-The following are the learning goals for this project:


1-Working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

2-Configuring NPM scripts

3-Working with event listeners and the Document Object Model

4-Configuring users and data storage through a back-end service

5-Working with a back-end service to store data from JavaScript

6-Designing and implementing a fully functioning web application

7-(Optionally) using React to simplify building a user interface
